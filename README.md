## Description
This is the assignment for ABB. This assignment it was initially focused on front-end, but I wanted to try to play with docker and socket.io so a node project for the BE is also provided.

## Installation and execution
This project is able to be executed using docker-compose.

To start the applications just execute: 
"docker-compose up -d"

It is docker so it should work directly, however in case it wouldn't work for any reason:
- Go to './frontend' and run 'npm install'
- Go to './backend' and run 'npm install'
- On the back
